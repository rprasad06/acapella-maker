## Description

Acapella Maker is a program that allows the user to record multiple audio tracks, with the option of using a metronome to record in time. Then, these audio tracks can be merged into a single track and exported as a high-quality audio wav file.

This program is useful for recording harmonies with voice or instruments. 

## Usage

The user is greeted with a project page. First, you should set the metronome tempo and meter in the Metronome Settings page. Make sure you do this at the start; you will not be able to change this later on when tracks are already recorded (Opening the metronome settings page will reset the data in the recorded tracks).

Then, you can get started with recording your audio!

Here is an overview of the different options for recording.

- **Record to audio track:** This is where you select which audio track out of the three to record to. When a segment is recorded, it will be saved to the selected track.

- **Metronome while Recording:** Clicking the metronome icon will toggle metronome while recording. When enabled, the metronomne will play during the recording with an optional count-in before the recording starts. It is recommended to use wired headphones with this feature. If not using headphones, the sound of the metrophone may be picked up by the microphone and show up in the final recording. Wired headphones will eliminate any latency that may arise with wireless headphones.

- **Record:** The record icon will start the recording upon press. If there is a count-in, it will start recording after the count-in. Upon pressing while recording, the recording will stop and save to the selected audio file.

- **Stop:** This button will stop recording if currently recording.

- **Microphone:** Here, you can select which microphone to use while recording.

- **Microphone Monitoring:** Press the icon to toggle monitoring. This is a powerful tool that is used in many recording applications. Monitoring feeds a live stream of what the microphone hears back to the user. This is useful for testing if a microphone works, hearing a preview of what the program will listen for, and if recording, being able to hear yourself singing or playing.

**It is important that you do** ***not*** **use this feature without headphones. If not using headphones, the sound will play back through the device's speakers and be picked back up through the microphone and, as expected, create a feedback loop.**

- **Compile Audio:** When you are done recording individual tracks, you can press the compile audio button to compile however many tracks you recorded into a final merged audio track. Then, you can listen to your fianl result and download it buy pressing the three buttons on the side!
